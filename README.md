Hi guys my name is Michael, and I am a 21 Year Old Self Taught Front End Dev soon to be Full Stack!

Here's some things about be:

- I've been working at everyones favorite grocery store, Trader Joe's for the past 4 Years 🙇🏽‍♂️ and 
loving every second of it!
- I started self teaching at the age of 17 with Python
- Born and Raised in NYC 🗽
- I definitely enjoy referenceing and posting memes a little too much 🤣
- No matter what mood i'm in what mood I'm currently in, watching any Gordon Ramsay show or 
video will keep me entertained for hours. I honestly believe that he's more intimidating when he's 
not yelling 😭
